Estero is kind of a similar one, but with a different approach, entirely different approach of how things should work and how minimalistic things can be. Hey there everyone my name is Atesh and I make a lot of coding videos including follow followable tutorials where you can just follow along with me and latest industry tech news. What's happening around what's going on in the AI space? What's going in the coding space and a lot of other fun stuff happens on this channel. So in case you are new here, go ahead, hit that subscribe. And in today's video I will walk you through with Astro. My some thoughtss about it, how I'm using it in the production. And there is also a new component library in the Astro which is going to make life a little bit easier. It's not really a fancy library that is going to change everything with the animations and stuff. It's very basic, minimalistic, just like Astro is so first let me walk you through that. What is Astro? How does it work and where I' am using it? And what my audience who is actually consuming the content via the Estero website. What what's their thought and feedback that comes to me? So let me share the screen with you. So this is the website which is built totally in the Astro I'll come back onto this one. First of all this is Astro. So as they say this is the framework the web framework for content driven website. So website has a lot of things that you can build and each framework is specialized in some or the other kind of a thing. Next year has its own specialty, remix has its own specialty and there are websites which are very content driven especially like application like docs, application like blogs even e-commerce website because you don't load the product every next day that are already loaded product and not the whole website needs to be entirely dynamic. Some of the portions can be dynamic and that's what the thought process is behind. The estero. So if you go ahead and look for it, of course the bigger names are here and Estero is a javascript WE framework optimized for building fast and the content driven website. The keyword here is the content driven. If you have too much of the content on your website, then Estero actually serves really well. It doesn't consume too much of the bandwidth can be loaded up majorly from the cds itself, and the performance is really nice and you don't have to do any configuration for that. It's out of the box and again no Astro guys don't even know that I'm making a video on that. The whole point was to make a video on this component library, but I'm just setting up the stage so that you know what Thero is and where I'm actually using what I really like about the Estero concept is the Estero island, so the concept here is let's first read this and then I'll walk you through islands. Optimize your website like no other. Web framework cam leverage Astros unique page load performance to improve the conversion rate. Core web vitals ino. So what the Estero says that not whole of your website needs to be loaded up via the javascript and you can pinpoint and plant the javascript only where it is needed. Maybe in some buttons maybe some click behaviors or some kind of a things, and that's what the Estero Islands denote that. No, we are not going to load the entire websites with just with the whole javascript and notice here it says zero locking. And yes, that is very, very true with thero. You can just go ahead and move it or integrate it in any framework that you like. And a whole lot of things are there. I can probably make a separate video on just the features of Estero, so I found it really interesting that what escrow can do and notice here there are landing pages, examples, portfolios. A lot of portfolios are there, e-commerce, some of the trendings, blogs, docs. A whole lot of things are there in the Astro that you can do one. The thing where I use Estero is on my doc's website. Of course, it's a lot of work that you have to maintain your own infrastructure. And of course I have to maintain my code and push it on the github and have to deploy this. But I think it's definitely doable when there is such things like that, and again these two blocks are not aligned. It's intentional, it's fun. And when I click on the Estero docs and go onto the GI in github. This is how the docs look like they're all beautiful and I can see all the diagrams the code blocks are there. I can just jump onto this. This is a classic. Typical documentation website doesn't consume any much of my bandwidth. Yes, of course, a little bit there because of the heavy traffic, but people actually love this. It's very simplistic. There are no bells and whistle, but that's how the documentation needs to be. It needs to be really, really simple. And that's where I actually use and this is the deployed version. You can also go ahead and check out the docs. Co. Dot com. Astro. Turns out this is a very basic and minimalistic application because in the Estero yes. I could have injected a lot more things and made it much more beautiful. But there is no dedicated or there was no dedicated component library so far for the Astro, which says Hey, we are for the Estero. Just then when I saw the full Dei and they just rolled out by the just. I mean to say a few hours ago they rolled out the Estero UI library again. The whole point of somebody who ising using Estero is not the fanciiness. It's all about the simplicity that they go after and this is kind of a consistent thing with the entire restauroom. So what they are bringing in is the prebuilt blocks and with just the props. So the whole idea is you don't need to do too much of the injection of the Tilman CSS and whatnot it's going to look just exactly same. You just change your content. That's the whole idea and that's the whole idea of the entire restauroom. This blog that you see here, it's totally run by MDX. Yeah, just the Markdown syntax with a little bit of the components on my own and that's what they are also going to do a head with this one and what I really like about the most is the blocks. Of course, the components are there, not very impressive, decently impressive as it's a work in progress. But compared to the previous versions this is much better. If you notice in the card section this is the first section which I always go in and check so this is how the card looks like and all you have to do is to grab. This card is just import the card from the UI and then there's your card, write your headings and text. The whole idea about Thera is focus on the content and willll take care of the functionality will take care of the component so this is what I really like. My favorite part about this library is the blocks. This is where I probably will save a whole lot of time. Notice here. There is this section here. If I go ahead and look for it. If I want to have this kind of a section, this is it. This is all yeah, this is literally the code that I have to inject. Notice here how teeny tiny that is and I'll have a section which just looks like this and this is optimized. I don't have to take care about. Where are the classes? Where are this? Where that this is the part where I like this this approach here. Notice here. If you want to have let's just say what do you want? You want to have a review section, that's it. You just focus on just putting or injecting the content that's it and this is going to just give you reviews like this. If you want a review like this scrollable just go ahead and have this. So many components are there yeah and it's all free. Available to you. Open source. And if you want to have, let's just say a hero section, yes, of course, there is a lot of room for improvement, but. It just works basic. You can have a nice image and just clickable links if you want to have certain like this. Of course, these are not the best hero section, but it does the job. If you want to have a website, just put some image, have some content here, just like we do at the home page. We have some of the content and just the logo. That's it. The simplicity is the key. Of course, as the library is going to grow ahead more, we progress more. We'll have more of the stuff that are nice. Notice here how cute this CTA is. Oh man. It just looks great out of the box I don't have to do. The fun part for me is I can focus just on the content and what I really want to do. It matches the name of Astra which is content driven. Website. The whole thing is the whole point is the content. So if you think you want to build something which is heavily content focused. I think this could be a good one. Go ahead and try this out. It's really fun and if you read the docs of the Estero, you can do pretty much, almost everything. Api calls to whatever you want to do almost everything up here. But yes, of course, there's a way to learn about Thero, how the writing work, how the endpoint works, how the middleware works into that. But there's a great documentation on it. And if you wish I can just help you out in creating a crash course or something with that. I've been using it for a while and I love I'm loving it, I'm loving the experience of exploring it, I'm loving the experience of going into the darks again. This is just an exploratory video to show you that. Yes, there is something really new and interesting and it's getting supported by these U libraries, so go ahead, check it out and this is it. This is just a regular video where I try to explore tech with you. Until want to show you that? Hey, you are ready for a new tech or not. Hey, this is something out. Go ahead. Check it out. That's it for this video. A new library is here. Full de UI again. It's not a sponsored video. Hits a open source library. Astro doesn't even know about this video. Is out there. So yeah, that is it from my side. I really like to introduce you to the new stuff that is coming out. That's what I enjoy the most bringing new tech to you, so that you can also try and explore that that is it. For this video, let's catch up in the next one."},"outputs":[{"results":{"message":{"text_key":"text","data":{"timestamp":"2025-01-01T14:38:52","sender":"Machine","sender_name":"AI","session_id":"de602d29-bd84-4761-80c0-091755d4292a","text":"Strengths:\n\n1.
